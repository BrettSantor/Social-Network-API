This is an API for a Social Network, it utilizes RESTful routes to create, read, update and delete data such as users and thoughts to a database using Mongoose.

## Installation 
 You will need to run a npm install to install all the dependencies needed to run this application. You will also need a tool like Insomia to test the routes of this application.
## Usage 
After installing dependencies you can start the server by running npm start in your terminal. This will allow Insomia to connect your local server and test the routes.

 ## Learning Points
 Building this API allowed me to interact with MongoDB using the Mongoose Object Data Modeling library. Utilizing models in a same but different way as a mysql database was a good transitioning point to a nosql database.

The routes were also the same but different and made this transition easier
